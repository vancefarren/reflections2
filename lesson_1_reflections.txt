Viewing a diff between two versions of a file rapidly increased
the rate at which differences could be discovered.  In a code 
document of several thousand lines, this would be invaluable.

Having access to the entire history of the file would make me a more
efficient programmer by easily restoring the last functioning version
of a program in the event that the current version is inexplicably broken.
Even if the differences between immediately prior versions can be seen,
it may not be thoroughly understood why the program is not working.  A much
earlier version of the program may need to be accessed, and a different 
development path chosen.

Manual Commits

Pros: good organization of versions
Cons: more complicated method of saving documents

Using Git to View History

Use git log to discover commit history, including ID tags and comments
regarding what was changed.  Use git diff to quickly determine the exact
changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I will obviously be more confident in making changes if I can revert to a previous version.

What do you want to use Git for?
I want to use git to complete the Android Developer Nanodegree.  I am sure that other uses will
arise in the future.
