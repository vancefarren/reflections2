Having access to the entire history of the file would make me a more
efficient programmer by easily restoring the last functioning version
of a program in the event that the current version is inexplicably broken.
Even if the differences between immediately prior versions can be seen,
it may not be thoroughly understood why the program is not working.  A much
earlier version of the program may need to be accessed, and a different 
development path chosen.
